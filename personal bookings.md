On your homepage, you’ll notice a pre-built meeting type with a set duration (30-mis meeting, 15-mis meeting). Think of a meeting type as a meeting that you’ll schedule regularly, like a product demo, customer call, or office hours.

Choose to either:

#### Create a new event type ####
Show create new meeting type flow

#### We’ll point out a few important settings: ####

Duration: Choose how long your event will be.

Schedule customization: Define your availability that suits you.

Close collaborators: These are people with whom you have the highest frequency of collaboration. But checking the checkbox, you automatically share your booking page link with them via email enabling them to book time with you.

Buffers: Add time before and after meetings to build in breaks.
